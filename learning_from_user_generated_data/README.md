# Exercise 1: RecSys Basics I

### **Overview**
This assignment explores **recommender systems**, focusing on interaction-based filtering and popularity-based recommendations using music (LFM-2B) and movie (MovieLens-1M) datasets.

### **Key Tasks**

- **Interaction Matrix**  
  - Constructed a binary user-item interaction matrix based on implicit feedback.
  - Applied a thresholding mechanism to filter out insignificant interactions.

- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**  
  - Implemented a baseline recommender that suggests the most popular unseen items.
  - Ensured efficient ranking and exclusion of previously consumed content.
  - Extended the popularity-based approach to recommend items based on regional preferences.
