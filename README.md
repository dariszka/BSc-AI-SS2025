### Repository Structure
This repository organizes different programming assignments done during my fourth semester into individual folders for each subject. Each folder contains a README with an overview and details of the key tasks performed. The structure is designed to showcase a progression of skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. All projects done by me, all summaries done by ChatGPT.
